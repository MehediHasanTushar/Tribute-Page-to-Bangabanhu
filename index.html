                    Pakistan" instead of "East Bengal." We had demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead
                    of Pakistan. The word "Bengal" has a history, has a tradition of its own. You can change it only
                    after the people have been consulted. So far as the question of One Unit is concerned it can come in
                    the Constitution. Why do you want it to be taken up just now? What about the state language,
                    Bengali? We will be prepared to consider one-unit with all these things. So I appeal to my friends
                    on that in the form of plebiscite.

                        plan titled Our Charter of Survival at a national conference of opposition political parties at
                        Lahore,[4] in which he demanded self-government and considerable political, economic and defence
                        autonomy for East Pakistan in a Pakistani federation with a weak central government.[24]
                        According to his plan:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense on the
                                Lahore Resolution and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a
                                legislature directly elected on the basis of the universal adult franchise.
                            </li>

                                The federal government should deal with only two subjects: defense and foreign affairs,
                                and all other residuary subjects shall be vested in the federating states.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should be introduced; or
                                if this is not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but
                                effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital
                                from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate banking reserve should be
                                established and separate fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Pakistan.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The power of taxation and revenue collection shall be vested in the federating units and
                                the federal center will have no such power. The Federation will be entitled to a share
                                in the state taxes to meet its expenditures.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two
                                wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the
                                two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of
                                duty between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish
                                trade links with foreign countries.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                East Pakistan should have a separate militia or paramilitary forces.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        Mujib's points catalysed public support across East Pakistan, launching what some historians
                        have termed the 6-point movement – recognized as the definitive gambit for autonomy and rights
                        of Bengalis in Pakistan. Mujib obtained the broad support of Bengalis, including the Hindu and
                        other religious communities in East Pakistan. However, his demands were considered radical in
                        West Pakistan and interpreted as thinly veiled separatism. The proposals alienated West
                        Pakistani people and politicians, as well as non-Bengalis and Muslim fundamentalists in East
                        Pakistan

                        out following its rejection. On 5 December 1969 Mujib made a declaration at a public meeting
                        held to observe the death anniversary of Suhrawardy that henceforth East Pakistan would be
                        called "Bangladesh":

                <div id="quateDiv" style="text-align:justify">
                    Mujib's declaration heightened tensions across the country. The West Pakistani politicians and the
                    military began to see him as a separatist leader. His assertion of Bengali cultural and ethnic
                    identity also re-defined the debate over regional autonomy. Many scholars and observers believed
                    the Bengali agitation emphasised the rejection of the Two-Nation Theory – the case upon which
                    Pakistan had been created – by asserting the Ethnocultural identity of Bengalis as a nation.
                    Mujib was able to galvanize support throughout East Pakistan, which was home to a majority of the
                    national population, thus making him one of the most powerful political figures in the Indian
                    subcontinent. It was following his 6-point plan that Mujib was increasingly referred to by his
                    supporters as "Bangabandhu" (literally meaning "Friend of Bengal" in Bengali).

                <h4>1970 elections and civil disobedience :</h4>
                <b>7 December 1970</b> - In the Pakistani general elections held on 7 December 1970, the Awami
                League under Mujib's leadership won a massive majority in the provincial legislature, and all
                but two of East Pakistan's quota of seats in the new National Assembly, thus forming a clear
                majority.
                <p>
                    The largest and most successful party in the western wing of the nation was the Pakistan
                    Peoples Party headed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He was completely opposed to Mujib's demand for
                    greater autonomy. Bhutto threatened to boycott the assembly and oppose the
                    government if Mujib was invited by Yahya Khan (then president of Pakistan) to form the next
                    government and demanded inclusion of the PPP. Much of the Pakistani military and the Islamic
                    political parties opposed Mujib becoming Pakistan's prime minister. At the time neither
                    Mujib nor the Awami League had explicitly advocated political independence for East
                    Pakistan, but smaller nationalist groups were demanding independence for Bangladesh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bhutto feared civil war, and sent a secret message to Mujib and his inner circle to arrange
                    a meeting with them. Hassan met with Mujib and persuaded him to form a coalition
                    government with Bhutto. They decided that Bhutto would serve as President, with Mujib as
                    Prime minister. These developments took place secretly and none of the Pakistan Armed Forces
                    personnel were kept informed. Meanwhile, Bhutto increased the pressure on Yahya Khan to take
                    a stand on dissolving the government.

                        National Parliament and Supreme Court, and codifying a One-party state into law.

                        <b>7 June 1975</b> - Mujib's political supporters in his party and a few others amalgamated to
                        form the only legal political party, the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League, commonly known
                        by its initials—BaKSAL. All MPs were required to join BaKSAL. The party
                        identified itself with the rural masses, farmers, and labourers and took control of all
                        mechanisms of government. It also launched major socialist programs. Under this new system,
                        Sheikh Mujib assumed the presidency and was given extraordinary powers. According to Time
                        magazine:

            <div id="quote" style="text-align:justify">
                Under the new system, executive powers are vested in the President, who will be elected directly every
                five years, and in a Council of Ministers appointed by him. Although an elected Parliament can pass
                legislation, the President has veto power and can dissolve Parliament indefinitely.

                BaKSAL was protested by different groups but they were punished by Mujib. It was known that Sheikh Mujib
                never accepted any criticism against him. Mujib was widely accused of the 40,000 killings by the Jatiya
                Rakkhi Bahini militia. Using government forces and his existing militia of supporters called the
                Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini, Mujib oversaw the arrest of opposition activists and strict control of political
                activities across the country.

                <ul style="text-align:justify">
                    On <b>15 August 1975</b>, a group of junior army officers invaded the presidential residence with
                    tanks and
                    killed Mujib, his family and personal staff.[4][103] Only his daughters Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh
                    Rehana, who were visiting West Germany at the time, escaped. They were banned from returning to
                    Bangladesh. The coup was planned by disgruntled Awami League colleagues and military officers, which
                    included Mujib's colleague and former confidanté Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, who became his immediate
                    successor. There was intense speculation in the media accusing the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
                    of having instigated the plot.[104] Lawrence Lifschultz has alleged that the CIA was involved in the
                    coup and assassination, basing his assumption on statements by the then-U.S. ambassador in Dhaka,
                    Eugene Booster.
